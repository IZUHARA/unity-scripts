### ScreenLineRenderer.cs
This tool uses a LineRenderer to draw a line on screen, given a TargetA and TargetB and a targetCamera. Because it uses a LineRenderer, it is advised to use a separate camera to render only the LineRenderer, so that it does not clip with the gameobjects in the world space.
